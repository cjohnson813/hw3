1. What does .. and -R mean?

    ..

    This signifies the parent directory (one level up from current).

    -R

    This tells the cp to copy the whole directory, not just a particular file.

To summarize: The command tells the cp to copy the entire public_html folder from
the parent directory into the currently selected directory.
